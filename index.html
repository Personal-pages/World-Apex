      <article>
        <h2>Home Minister Vows Retaliation After Pahalgam Terror Attack</h2>
        <p>
          Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday asserted that every terrorist involved in the <strong>Pahalgam attack</strong> will be hunted down and brought to justice. The attack, which targeted a security convoy in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district, has sparked national outrage and renewed counter-terror efforts in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah, addressing reporters, labeled the attack a "cowardly act" and emphasized the government’s zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism. “We will not rest until every terrorist involved is neutralized,” he declared. Security forces have already launched search operations across southern Kashmir.
        </p>

        <h2>Timeline of the Pahalgam Attack</h2>
        <h3>What Happened?</h3>
        <p>
          The incident occurred around 11:45 PM on Wednesday night. A group of heavily armed terrorists ambushed a CRPF convoy on the Pahalgam-Anantnag route using improvised explosive devices followed by automatic gunfire. Eyewitnesses described scenes of chaos as personnel scrambled for cover and retaliated.
        </p>

        <h3>How the Forces Responded</h3>
        <p>
          Within minutes, reinforcements from the Indian Army and J&K police were dispatched. A perimeter was established around the attack site, and aerial surveillance drones were deployed. Injured personnel were evacuated to the Army Base Hospital in Srinagar, while combing operations began immediately in adjacent forest areas.
        </p>

        <h2>Reactions from the Political Spectrum</h2>
        <p>
          Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed shortly after the attack. He expressed his condolences to the injured soldiers’ families and urged agencies to respond with “unrelenting force.” Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, “This tragedy highlights persistent intelligence gaps and operational lapses. We stand with our jawans but demand accountability.” Former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack and called for “an honest review of the current security strategy in the valley.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Several regional parties, including the PDP and NC, voiced concerns over recurring attacks in southern Kashmir. Mehbooba Mufti termed the attack “a tragic reminder that normalcy in Kashmir remains fragile and conditional.”
        </p>

        <h2>Expert and Security Analyst Commentary</h2>
        <p>
          Defense analyst Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Syed Ata Hasnain stated that the nature of the attack suggests the involvement of highly trained militants, likely aided by local logistics. “This isn’t just another infiltration; it’s part of a broader strategy to destabilize peace gains made over the past year,” he warned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Counter-insurgency expert Ajai Sahni added that attacks like this are also intended to trigger communal tensions and gain international attention. “Our response must be clinical and intelligence-driven, avoiding collateral harm while dismantling sleeper networks,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Former RAW officer N. Ravi emphasized the importance of HUMINT (human intelligence) in tackling such threats. “We need better on-ground assets, especially in volatile belts where trust in institutions is shaky,” he noted.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Means for Kashmir’s Security Landscape</h2>
        <p>
          The Pahalgam incident is not an isolated event but part of a shifting pattern in Kashmir’s insurgency matrix. Over the past 6 months, there has been a noticeable change in the tactics used—fewer direct attacks, more ambushes, and increased use of IEDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts believe that Pakistan-based terror outfits, under pressure from FATF regulations and international scrutiny, are relying on proxy operatives and sleeper cells in South Kashmir. With tourism booming in regions like Pahalgam and Gulmarg, militants aim to project insecurity and stall economic revival.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, the Ministry of Home Affairs is considering:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="material-icons">visibility</span> Enhanced cross-border surveillance using AI-powered UAVs</li>
            <li><span class="material-icons">military_tech</span> Deployment of elite NSG units in southern districts</li>
            <li><span class="material-icons">network_check</span> Upgrading communication infrastructure in remote forward posts</li>
            <li><span class="material-icons">psychology</span> Fast-tracking counter-radicalization programs</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is scheduled to visit Anantnag for a high-level meeting. His visit could signal a change in operational protocols and possibly a more aggressive stance on eliminating identified terror infrastructure across the LoC.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next few weeks will be crucial as joint operations continue. The government’s ability to maintain public confidence while delivering on its promise of justice will shape both domestic sentiment and international perception.

      <strong>North Korea and Russia have officially begun constructing their first-ever direct road link</strong>, marking a pivotal moment in their deepening alliance.
      <br><br>
      The strategic project aims to strengthen trade and logistics while signaling a united stance against international sanctions. The connection between North Korea's Rason region and Russia's Primorsky Krai may reshape geopolitical dynamics in Northeast Asia.

      Timeline of the Road Link Project
      
    </h2>
    <h3>
      
       What Happened?
    </h3>
    <p>
      In late April 2025, North Korea and Russia held a groundbreaking ceremony near the Rason-Primorsky border. Officials hailed the event as a symbol of "shared resistance" to global isolation. The road project had been in planning since 2022 but accelerated after recent Western sanctions.
    </p>

    <h3>
      
       How the Forces Responded
    </h3>
    <p>
      Security forces from both countries have been stationed near the proposed checkpoints. Russia has also deployed military engineers to assist construction, raising regional security concerns. The project is being guarded under high alert, given the sensitive nature of cross-border development.

    <h2>
      
      <span class="material-icons">psychology</span>Reactions from the Global Community
    </h2>
    <p>
      Western nations, particularly the U.S. and Japan, have expressed concern over the deepening ties between Pyongyang and Moscow. NATO officials called it a "clear alignment of authoritarian powers." Meanwhile, China has stayed silent, possibly viewing it as a counterbalance to Western pressure in the Pacific.

      Expert and Security Analyst Commentary
      <span class="material-icons arrow" style="color: green !important;">arrow_forward_ios</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      According to Dr. Elena Volkov, a geopolitical analyst at Moscow State University, "The road link is more than infrastructure — it’s a statement of resilience." Security expert Yoon-Sung Kim warned that it may also serve covert logistical or military purposes disguised as trade enhancements.
    </p>

        <span class="material-icons arrow" style="color: green !important;">arrow_forward_ios</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although geographically distant, this development sends a message about axis formations in Asia. Indian intelligence agencies are now re-evaluating foreign alliances near its borders. Kashmir, already a sensitive zone, might see increased strategic surveillance and diplomatic recalibrations in response to this growing Russia-North Korea-China triangle.

      <strong>Disgraced Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu has officially withdrawn from the next papal conclave</strong>, an almost unprecedented move tied to a high-profile Vatican financial scandal.
      <br><br>
      Once a powerful figure in the Roman Curia, Becciu’s withdrawal reflects a shift toward transparency inside the Church — but it also raises questions about influence, accountability, and the future of Vatican politics.
    </span>
  </p>

  <article>
    <h2>
      Timeline of the Scandal
        
    </h2>
    <h3>
       Origins of the Allegations
      
    </h3>
    <p>
      The financial scandal first came to light in 2019, involving a controversial $200 million London real estate investment tied to Becciu’s office. Vatican prosecutors accused him of embezzlement and nepotism. Although he denied wrongdoing, Pope Francis removed him from office in 2020.
    </p>

    <h3>
       Withdrawal from the Conclave
      
    </h3>
    <p>
      On April 24, 2025, Becciu submitted a formal letter to the Vatican declaring he would not participate in the next papal conclave. The decision was accepted without protest, effectively removing his influence from one of the Church’s most sacred processes.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span class="material-icons">visibility</span> Vatican Response & Public Reactions
     
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Holy See issued a brief statement acknowledging the withdrawal but did not offer further comment. Italian media and Vatican observers reacted strongly, calling it a “symbolic yet overdue gesture” that reflects the Church’s attempts at damage control. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      What Analysts Are Saying
        <span class="material-icons arrow" style="color: green !important;">arrow_forward_ios</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      According to Marco Politi, a veteran Vatican journalist, “Becciu stepping aside spares the Church a moral dilemma — allowing a compromised figure to vote for the next Pope would’ve undermined the conclave’s integrity.” Others argue this sets a powerful precedent for accountability.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What This Means for the Next Conclave
        <span class="material-icons arrow" style="color: green !important;">arrow_forward_ios</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Becciu’s absence slightly alters the balance of influence among cardinals. Some experts believe Pope Francis may quietly support reform-minded candidates, and the conclave could tilt toward transparency-oriented leadership. However, conservative factions remain strong.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>One fewer cardinal vote in the next conclave</li>
      <li>Stronger pressure on others facing allegations</li>
      <li>Signals a potential move toward financial reform</li>

                Hyperia macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed hyperiid, is a species of amphipod found in the deep waters of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. It is known for its distinctive large head, which makes it an easily recognizable species. The animal is transparent, with a slightly reddish hue, and typically grows up to 2 cm in length.
                <br><br>
                This species is a part of the food chain in its environment, serving as prey for larger marine creatures. Hyperia macrocephala feeds on planktonic organisms and other small marine creatures. Its eyes, located on the front of its large head, are adapted to help it detect changes in light, crucial for survival in the depths of the ocean where light is scarce.
                <br><br>
                The image showcases the delicate yet remarkable structure of Hyperia macrocephala, highlighting its importance in the cold marine ecosystems.
